# Why a Blog?

Over the years, I've found myself waffling back and forth on the idea of starting a blog. What should I write about? Can or should I write in a consistent interval? What is my ultimate motivation that will keep me coming back to writing?

Well, I've finally pulled the trigger to at least get something out. I plan for this to be a space to capture a few things, and be a means to tinker around with new tools and technologies. For example, Hugo (the static site generation framework) seemed like a good choice for a blog. 

A few other ideas that I might like to track here include:

- Notes and how-to's related to technologies and other things I'm tinkering with
- Opinions or thoughts on current trends in the tech sector
- Other topics (potentially non-technical) that I find interesting that I'd like to come back and reference

Perhaps at a future point I will track books or podcasts I've listened to or read, or am currently working my way through. 

I'll keep this short for now. Future posts will have more content.
